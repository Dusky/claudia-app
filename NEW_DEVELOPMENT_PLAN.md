## üéâ **SUMMARY**

**Previous Plans:** Focused on technical capabilities and advanced features  
**New Plan:** **User-first approach** addressing critical workflow gaps

**Key Insight:** Claudia has powerful core functionality but suffers from poor user experience around setup, error handling, and feature discovery. Users abandon the app not because it lacks features, but because they can't successfully use the features that exist.

**Strategic Shift:** From "build more features" to "make existing features accessible and reliable"

**Expected Outcome:** A production-ready application that non-technical users can successfully adopt and use, with confidence in data management and clear paths to feature discovery.

**Timeline:** 6 weeks to address all critical user experience gaps  
**Risk Level:** Low - building on solid technical foundation  
**Impact Level:** High - removes all major barriers to user adoption

This plan prioritizes user success over feature expansion, ensuring Claudia becomes a polished, accessible application that users can confidently adopt and recommend to others.
