## üö® CURRENT ISSUES TO ADDRESS

### **1. Text Overlap Problem** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Issue:** Chat messages still overlapping despite spacing fixes
**Current:** 8px padding + 1.5 line height + 4px margin
**Needs:** Investigation of react-window sizing calculations

### **2. Image Generation Polish** 
**Issue:** Basic loading states could be more informative
**Needs:** Progress indicators, estimated time, queue status

### **3. Settings Integration**
**Issue:** Some settings aren't fully integrated with existing systems
**Needs:** Settings changes to trigger immediate UI updates

---

## üìã IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Week 1)

### **Fix Critical Issues**
1. **Resolve text overlap** - Debug react-window height calculations
2. **Polish image generation UX** - Better loading states and error feedback
3. **Settings integration** - Ensure all settings apply immediately

### **Start Phase 3A: Provider Management**
1. **Design API key management UI** - Modal or dedicated settings section
2. **Implement key storage** - Secure local storage with encryption
3. **Provider status dashboard** - Visual indication of provider health

### **Week 2: Complete Provider Management**
1. **Model selection interface** - Dropdown for available models per provider

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

### **Current Gaps:**
1. **Provider hot-swapping** - Currently requires app restart
2. **Settings reactivity** - Some settings need manual refresh
3. **Error recovery** - Better handling of API failures
4. **Performance monitoring** - Track image generation times and costs

### **Future Extensibility:**
1. **Plugin system foundation** - For community extensions
2. **Theme editor** - User-created themes
3. **Personality sharing** - Import/export personality templates
4. **Voice integration** - TTS/STT for audio interaction
